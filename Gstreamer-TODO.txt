Gstreamer backend in Kodi.

Implemetation status:

- Build system.
DONE: Added support of gstreamer.
To build kodi with gstreamer support, use configure option '--enable-gstreamer'. GstPlayer will become a
default video player for kodi. Current implemetation is based on Linaro one https://github.com/robclark/xbmc/tree/linaro.

- Video player.
DONE: basic functionality (playback, seeking, fastforward etc.). Added ability to configure playbin 
via xml file (./system/players/gstplayer/gstplayers.xml) wich allows to configure audio/video sink and flags for playbin.
TODO: getting information from the audio/video streams, subtitles support.

- Music player.
Music player is the same player as video.

- Integration with renderer.
DONE: Simple integration is done only for testing purpose on desktop (see OutputPicture function in GstPlayer).
TODO: Implement renderer for embedded system.
There are two possibilities: video hole and EglImages.
Video hole: Gstreamer draw video without kodi renderer under the Kodi GUI (e.g gstreamer decoder in secured mode),
in kodi renderer we have transparent background. There could be issues with weston transparency and other launched application.
EglImage: The idea is to create eglImage inside of some gstreamer plugin and pass it 
(e.g via app sink) to Kodi. So there should be implemented gstreamer plugin that create eglImages, in Kodi renderer (LinuxRendererGLES)
need to implement eglImage handling (or just adapte one that is made for libstagefright).
All vendor specific logic should be encapsulated in specific gstreamer plugins.

- AudioEngine
At the moment implementation doesn't require AudioEngine for video and audio player.
Sound output is handled by gstreamer.

- Disable ffmpeg.
TODO: Refactor Kodi code to avoid ffmpeg dependency (DVDPlayer, AudioEngine, etc.). Using ffmpeg could bring a licence issue.

At current stage video and music player work on desktop (tested on Fedora 19).
